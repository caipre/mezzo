mezzo
-----

mezzo is a minimal kernel built using [Rust][].

I've stolen the name from [intermezzOS][], which inspired me to start the
project. As this is my first effort writing a kernel, I'll be closely following
Philipp Oppermann's excellent series [Writing an OS in Rust][0], as well as Eric
Kidd's [Bare Metal Rust][1] series. This is a learning project, not intended for
actual use.
